description: Writes and runs E2E tests to verify that implemented code meets the defined acceptance criteria. Use this skill after implementing a feature to ensure it fulfills the requirements and is ready for deployment. Trigger on phrases like "verify this", "write E2E tests", "check acceptance criteria", or whenever a spec or implementation is ready for end-to-end verification.

# Verify skill

## Role
Act as a quality assurance engineer.

## Task
Given a specification file, write and run E2E tests that cover all acceptance criteria and confirm the implementation is correct.

## Context

### Input

- Spec: `{Product_Folder}/specs/{slug}.spec.md`

### Prerequisites
- There is an e2e strategy in the system architecture
- The e2e archetype (language and framework) is already installed and configured

### References
- System architecture at `{Product_Folder}/arch/system.arch.md`
- Rules with E2E codification instructions `{Rules_Folder}/e2e.rules.md`
- Framework guide (e.g. [Playwright](./playwright.md))

## Steps

### Step 1: Clarify the input
- [ ] Read the spec to understand the feature and acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Read `AGENTS.md` and system architecture for tech stack and testing framework.
- [ ] If spec or framework is unclear, ask the minimum questions needed.

### Step 2: Review acceptance criteria
- [ ] List all criteria to verify from the spec.
- [ ] Cross-check against [testing.guidelines.md](./testing.guidelines.md) when adding or extending tests.

### Step 3: Write E2E tests
- [ ] Cover all criteria and edge cases; 
- [ ] Arrange-Act-Assert where applicable; 
- [ ] Prefer isolated tests.
- [ ] Group tests by feature or page.
- [ ] Use descriptive names for suites and test groups.
- [ ] Write the happy path test.
- [ ] Write the edge cases tests.
- [ ] Write the error cases tests.

### Step 4: Run and verify
- [ ] Set up the test environment.
- [ ] Run the tests and read the results.
- [ ] If tests pass, go to step 5.
- [ ] Fix any error caused by bad test implementation.
- [ ] Never change the application code to make tests pass.
- [ ] If tests keep failing, stop iterating.
- [ ] Tear down the test environment.

### Step 5: Record outcomes
- [ ] Mark each criterion in the spec as `[x]` when tests pass.
- [ ] Leave failed criteria as `[ ]` in the spec.
- [ ] When tests fail, add or update a **Rectify** section in the spec: failing test names, expected vs actual, and suggested fix per failure.

## Output
- [ ] E2E test suite executed.
- [ ] Spec acceptance criteria and Rectify section updated when applicable.
- [ ] Keep spec as `in-progress` until all criteria pass.
- [ ] Commit with conventional message (`test`; scope `e2e` or `{slug}`).
- [ ] If there are failures, suggest `/rectify` on `{slug}.spec.md`.
- [ ] If all tests pass, suggest `/review` for a11y, security, and performance.

## Verification
- [ ] All tests are executed.
- [ ] Servers or apps are stopped.
