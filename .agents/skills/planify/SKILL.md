name: planify
description: Generates implementation plan files from a spec. Use this skill when the user wants to break down a spec, into actionable implementation steps. Trigger on phrases like "planify this", "create a plan for", "break this down", or whenever a spec is ready to be planned before coding.

# Planify skill

## Role
Act as a senior analyst.

## Task
Given a spec produce one or more implementation plan files — one per tier — that break the solution into ordered, actionable steps ready for coding.

## Context

### Input
- The spec file: `{Product_Folder}/specs/{slug}.spec.md` 

### Prerequisites
- `{Product_Folder}/arch/system.arch.md` — run `/explore` if missing.
- `{tier}.arch.md` and `ER.md` for tiers in scope — run `/elaborate` if missing.

### References

- Architectural decisions at `{Product_Folder}/arch/ADR.md`
- Entity relationships at `{Product_Folder}/arch/ER.md`
- Tier architecture at `{Product_Folder}/arch/{tier}.arch.md`
- [Plan template](./plan.template.md)

### Plan naming convention

`{Product_Folder}/plans/{slug}.{tier?}.plan.md` 
- `{slug}`: the slug of the spec or derived from the input.
- `{tier?}`: `back` | `front` | `db` | `fullstack` | omit.

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the input
- [ ] If incomplete or ambiguous, document assumptions and proceed with best-effort.

### Step 2: Identify tiers
- [ ] Tiers: `back`, `front`, `db`, or fullstack. 
- [ ] Choose the tiers from the spec and go one by one.

### Step 3: Draft the implementation steps for the tier
- [ ] Per tier: ordered steps with titles, descriptions, and paths; traceable to input.
- [ ] Do not add extra steps or task for testing or documentation.
- [ ] Respect ADRs and arch constraints.
- [ ] Frontmatter: 
  - `slug` matches `{slug}`
  - `tier` is `back` | `front` | `db` | `fullstack` | omit
  - `status` is `pending`

## Output
- [ ] Write the plan file(s) under `{Product_Folder}/plans/{slug}.{tier?}.plan.md`
- [ ] Suggest `/codify` to write the code for the implementation steps.

## Verification
- [ ] Each plan is complete, ordered, and actionable without extra context.
- [ ] Frontmatter and filename slug align; status is `pending`.
